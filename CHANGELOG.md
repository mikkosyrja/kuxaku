Moved the Sol Ring position from the bottom right quadrant to the bottom left quadrant in the outer planet map. In Abaddon's Gate Holden says: "This is the Ring. And this is Uranus. They are literally the two spots furthest from each other in the universe that have humans near them". Uranus happens to be in the top right quadrant.
