Moved the Sol Ring position from the bottom right quadrant to the bottom left quadrant in the outer planet map. In Abaddon's Gate Holden says: "This is the Ring. And this is Uranus. They are literally the two spots furthest from each other in the universe that have humans near them". Uranus happens to be in the top right quadrant.

Added LyX document for creating PDF describing the Solar System and Asteroid Belt for players with Python script generated images. Example file [example.pdf](example.pdf) shows the result. Colonized asteroid information comes from the RPG rulebook. Other asteroid descriptions are taken from Wikipedia with some modifications.

Added Darian calendar conversion for Martian dates. All generated image titles display Darian date in parenthesis after the Gregorian date. These are created by separate Python module darian.py.

Updated example images and documents.
