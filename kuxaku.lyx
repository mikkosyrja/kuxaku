System maps use two different scales,
 either Gm or AU.
 Gm is a standard SI unit gigameter (million kilometers).
 AU is an astronomical unit:
 distance from the Earth to the Sun (roughly 150 million kilometers or 150 Gm).
 Gm is used within gas giant systems (Jupiter and Saturn).

\begin_layout Standard
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun.
 The smallest planet in the Sol System,
 it has no natural satellites.
 Besides impact craters,
 its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were produced by a period of contraction early in its history.
 Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind.
 Its has relatively large iron core and thin mantle.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Venus is the Sol System’s second planet,
 and while similar in size and mass to Earth,
 it is strikingly different in almost every other way.
 Venus has a retrograde rotation,
 meaning it rotates clockwise,
 as opposed to the counter-clockwise rotations of most of the Sol System’s other planets.
 Although Venus’ gravity is just slightly lower than that of Earth,
 the planet’s incredibly dense carbon dioxide atmosphere results in crushing atmospheric pressure at the surface 92 times greater than Earth’s.
 It also creates a powerful greenhouse effect,
 leading to surface temperatures of 735 K,
 making Venus the hottest planet in the Sol System —
 hotter even than the surface of Mercury.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although it was the first planet to be visited and landed on by unmanned spacecraft from Earth in the 20th century,
 Venus has never been colonized by humans.

The third planet from the Sun and the birthplace of humanity,
 Earth stands as the cultural,
 political,
 and economic center of the Sol System.
 It remains the only world in the system with a breathable atmosphere where people can live outdoors under an open sky.
 Home to 30 billion people,
 Earth struggles under the effects of climate change,
 environmental pollution,
 overpopulation,
 and widespread unemployment,
 but its corporations are the wealthiest and most powerful in the system.
 It is heavily reliant on the resources of the Belt to keep the engine of its economy running,
 yet the grip Earth once held on its interplanetary colonies is slowly slipping away.

Luna
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Luna is Earth’s only natural satellite.
 It is only a quarter of Earth’s diameter,
 with a gravity of 0.16 g —
 lighter than many spin stations in the Belt.
 Only 384,402 kilometers away from Earth,
 Luna was the site of humanity’s first landing on another planet,
 as well as the location of Earth’s first interplanetary colony,
 established in the early 21st century.
 This first permanent lunar base was a shared military and scientific endeavor,
 and while elements of both remain,
 Luna is now much more of a civilian station.
 Like Earth,
 Luna is governed by the United Nations,
 and the approximately one billion inhabitants of Luna are considered full UN citizens.

\begin_layout Standard
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Sol System,
 being larger than only Mercury.
 It has a surface gravity of 0.38 g and a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land.
 The the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
 Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere,
 with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys,
 deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Martian Congressional Republic rules over four billion people who are spread across Mars,
 associated orbital stations,
 and the small but highly advanced military fleets cruising the Sol System.
 Settled in the 21st century after a number of lengthy exploratory missions,
 Mars is a world of dreamers,
 devoted to a single vision:
 the greening of the red planet.

 Phobos orbits 6,000
\begin_inset space ~

 closer to its primary body than any other known planetary moon.
 It is so close that it orbits Mars much faster than Mars rotates,
 and completes an orbit in just 7 hours and 39 minutes.
 As a result,
 from the surface of Mars it appears to rise in the west,
 move across the sky in 4 hours and 15 minutes or less,
 and set in the east,
 twice each Martian day.

 It no longer exists as such.
 Following nuclear annihilation of the Earth-Mars joint Phoebe Research Station and the Saturnian satellite in the wake of the Eros Incident,
 the United Nations destroyed one of Mars’ two moons.
 Prior to becoming a smudge in the Martian sky,
 Deimos hosted military facilities and a deep radar station.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Atira asteroids are asteroids whose orbits are entirely confined within Earth's orbit.
 They are by far the smallest group of near-Earth objects.
 Earth-crossers whose semi-major axes are smaller than Earth's are Aten asteroids.
 The remaining ones are Apollo asteroids,
 which are the largest group of near-Earth objects.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Sol System,
 located roughly between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars,
 that is occupied by a great many solid,
 irregularly shaped bodies,
 of many sizes but much smaller than planets,
 called asteroids or minor planets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The identified objects are of many sizes and,
 on average,
 are about one million kilometers apart.
 About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids and the total mass is approximately 4% that of the Moon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three broad composition classes of asteroids are C-,
 S-,
 and M-types:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
C-type C-type (chondrite) asteroids are most common.
 They consist of clay and silicate rocks,
 and are dark in appearance.
 They are among the most ancient objects in the Sol System.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
S-type S-types ("stony") are made up of silicate materials and nickel-iron.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
M-type M-types are metallic (nickel-iron).
 The asteroids' compositional differences are related to how far from the Sun they formed.
 Some experienced high temperatures after they formed and partly melted,
 with iron sinking to the center and forcing basaltic (volcanic) lava to the surface.

Enceladus

 Enceladus is about 500 kilometers in diameter.
 It is mostly covered by fresh,
 clean ice,
 making it one of the most reflective bodies of the Sol System.
 Geyser observations,
 along with the finding of escaping internal heat and very few impact craters in the south polar region,
 show that Enceladus is currently geologically active.
 Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity,
 which is damped by tidal forces,
 tidally heating its interior and driving the geological activity.
 Plumes from Enceladus,
 which are similar in composition to comets,
 have been shown to be the source of the material in Saturn's E ring.

 However,
 reflecting Saturn's greater mass,
 Dione's orbital period is one tenth that of the Moon.
 Dione is currently in a 1:2 mean-motion orbital resonance with moon Enceladus,

Distances
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the few true constants in the universe remains the speed of light.
 Whether communications are sent as radio waves or on the laser of a tightbeam,
 they travel 300,000 kilometers per second.
 Often a message can be slowed while the receiver waits for redundant copies of lost packets of data to arrive,
 or for a message to work its way to the top of the queue at a tightbeam relay station and get passed along on the next stage of its journey.
 Worse,
 a distance of 15 light minutes between Earth and Ceres doesn’t mean it takes 15 minutes to establish a connection:
 it means it takes 15 minutes for the first part of the message to travel the distance (“How are you?”),
 then another 15 minutes for the reply to return (“I’m fine,
 thanks.”).
 Conversations of alternating messages can take hours or days to complete.
 Because of this,
 most transmitted conversations are sent as recorded messages rather than attempting a live conversation,
 unless the light-speed delay is only a few seconds.

Delay between Earth and Luna is about 1.3 seconds.
 Likewise,
 in Saturn's inner system,
 delays are always within 2 seconds.
 Delay between outmost Iapetus and inner Saturn system is less than 15 seconds.

Travel Times
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the Epstein Drive removed Δv limitations to space travel,
 ships no longer needed to execute Hohmann transfers to maneuver between bodies.
 To transfer,
 ships can simply burn prograde at a constant rate,
 then flip around and decelerate by burning retrograde.
 This maneuver is called a Brachistochrone trajectory,
 from the Greek meaning “shortest time.” A course using this maneuver tends to be curved as it uses the sun’s gravity to increase the ship’s acceleration.

\begin_layout Standard
The time it takes to execute a flight path along a Brachistochrone trajectory depends on two factors:
 the distance between the two points,
 and the acceleration of the ship.
 The greater the acceleration,
 the less time it takes to travel,
 but the multiple g-forces created by these “hard burns” are extremely stressful on the human body.
 Crash couches and pharmaceutical cocktails like “the juice” alleviate some,
 but not all,
 of the damage inflicted by the hardest burns.

Note that the actual travel times will be somewhat longer.
 Spaceport bureaucracy and other travel regulations usually need at least one hour at both ends of the journey.
